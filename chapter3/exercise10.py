"""Write a program that determine the length of a ladder required to reach a given height when leaned
against a house. The height and angle of the ladder are given as inputs. To compute use:

length = height
        -------
        sin angle

Note: The angle must be in radians. Prompt for an angle in degrees and use this formula to convert:

radians = Ï€
        ----  degrees
